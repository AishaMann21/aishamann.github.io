        <p>Hello there!<br>
        My name is Aisha Mann and I am from Brooklyn, New York. I am currently a senior at High School for Youth and Community Development and I love to code!In my junior year of high school, I took the fundamental coding class offered by ScripEd and got introduced to the AMAZING world of tech. I love exploring Computer Science through taking part in various tech based programs and making websites and web-apps out of scratch. Having attended several technical forums and practicing coding first hand, my interests have lied in the field of Computer Science. Women, being a minority in tech, face discrimination and this particularly caused me to learn coding because I wish to break the stereotype. I am also enrolled in the ScripEd Advanced Class this year where I will be closely working with tech industry professionals to get a deeper understanding of coding. I believe that the skills that I have learnt so far and will further learn in the future will lead my way in college where I can incorporate my interests and skills in coding to pursue a degree in Computer Science. </p>
