        <p>Early in the year of 2018, I worked in a program with a program called Gakko where I had the chance to learn and make a web-app. Working on that project with Gakko has to be my most meaningful commitment because it helped me design, build, and release an App that addresses a problem I identified in my community. The problem that I identified was lack of cleanliness in public schools which disrupts the learning environment and also the lack of responsibility of the administration in addressing the problem. As a solution, I created a web-app called Snapklean which allows students to take photos of school spaces that need cleaning up and then send it to a designated school administrator.
